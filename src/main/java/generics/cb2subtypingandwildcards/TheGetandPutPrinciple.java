/**
 * 2.4. The Get and Put Principle
 *
 * The Get and Put Principle:
 * Extends: use an extends wildcard when you only get values out of a structure (Extend => gEt)
 * Super:   use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure      (sUper  => pUt)
 * None:    donâ€™t use a wildcard when you both get and put.                     (nOne   => bOth)
 *
 * You may find it helpful to think of ?
 * extends T as containing every type in an interval bounded by the type of null below and by T above
 * (where the type of null is a subtype of every reference type).
 * Similarly, you may think of ? super T as containing every type in an interval bounded by T below and
 * by Object above
 *
