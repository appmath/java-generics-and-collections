The Get and Put Principle:
1) GET: restricts the type with EXTENDS  (UP TO THIS TYPE)
    Use an extends wildcard when you only get values out of a structure: (List<? extends T> src)
    Think of gEt == ExtEnds

2) PUT: opens up the type with SUPER  (STARTING WITH THIS TYPE)
    Use a super wildcard when you only put values into a structure: (List< ? super T> dst)
    Think of pUt == sUper

3) Donâ€™t use a wildcard when you both get and put.

public static <T> void copy(List<? super T> dst, List<? extends T> src) {
        for (T t : src) {
            dst.add(t);
        }
